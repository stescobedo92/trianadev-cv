In this context, the ATcnea project had been started with the idea of creating a full technological classroom in which teachers use a laptop and a digital board and each student is provided a tablet.\n\n The project has two applications — a desktop application for the teacher and a mobile app for students. The objective is to be able to control and teach the classes using these devices, control student attendance, conduct questionnaires, and keep track of homework.\n\n The teacher has an electronic board on which, as he writes, the content is updated in real-time on the students' tablets. Similarly, students can write on their tablets and reflect their contributions to the board. It is two-way communication in order to make the teaching process more efficient.\n\n- Task: \n - Implement the authentication module.\n - Implement a module for bidirectional communication between the teachers’ and the students’ application through a Socket connection.\n - Implement Board component with all features for creating and handling text, images, and elements like geometric forms.\n - Implement Quiz component with different types of questions and interactive features.\n - Configure Continuous Integration of the project, to automatically generate the Android application after pushing new changes in Gitlab.\n\n- Role: Android Developer\n\n- Team: 1 Project Manager, 2 ScrumMasters, 7 Developers\n\n- Technologies: **Android**, **JavaFX**, **Java**, **Doctrine**, **GreenDAO**, **Socket**\n\n---\n## Post-degree\n\n### Courses\n  \n(2018-Mar-22) Competitive Programming Course by Artsem Zhuk\n\n(2018-Jul-05) Competitive Programming Course by Pablo Zimmermann\n\n\n## Events\n\n### University\n \n(2016) Pachamama Game Jam\n\n(2017) Pachamama Game Jam\n\n(2017) Global Game Jam\n"
